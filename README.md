# Escape Clause README

Welcome to Escape Clause!

The programming language LISP was designed to help programmers remove the worry of squinting and closing all their brackets
in a line manually by simply putting a ']' at the end of their line. Today, those of us not writing LISP don't really have
that luxury. Until now - with Escape Clause simply press 'ctrl + ]' (or 'cmd + ]' on a mac) and all your open brackets will
automatically be closed. You can also trigger the command "Escape Clause" from the command palette.  

## Features

Trigger Escape Clause by: /n
'ctrl + ]' on Windows
'cmd + ]' on Mac
Selecting Escape Clause on command palette ('ctrl + shift + p)

Ignores already closed brackets (partially closed lines)
Checks for extra incorrect brackets and warns users
